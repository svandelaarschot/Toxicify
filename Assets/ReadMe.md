Toxicify

Keep your runs clean and fun — mark toxic players and highlight the pumpers!

Toxicify helps you keep track of players you encounter in dungeons, raids, PvP, or the Group Finder. With one click or command, you can tag a player as Toxic (to avoid them in the future) or as a Pumper (great teammates you want to remember).

Once added, players are clearly highlighted in your party/raid frames, tooltips, and the Group Finder. You’ll never forget who ruined your key — or who carried it!
