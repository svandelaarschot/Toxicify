# Toxicify

**Keep your runs clean and fun ‚Äî mark toxic players and highlight the pumpers!**

Toxicify helps you keep track of players you encounter in dungeons, raids, PvP, or the Group Finder. With one click or command, you can tag a player as **Toxic** (to avoid them in the future) or as a **Pumper** (great teammates you want to remember).

Once added, players are clearly highlighted in your party/raid frames, tooltips, and the Group Finder. You'll never forget who ruined your key ‚Äî or who carried it!
